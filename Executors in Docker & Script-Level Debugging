1.	How would you create a basic Docker?

To create a Docker container, first, make sure all dependencies are installed.
Then you need to create a text file (e.g. DockerFile) in the root directory of the project.
Inside the docker file you need to add all the instructions to the define what the image will do and run. 
For example:
- Define Base Image (e.g. FROM php:8.2-cli)
- Set Working Directory (e.g. WORKDIR /app)
- Copy Application Files (e.g. COPY . /app)
- Make Script Executable (e.g. RUN chmod +x /app/task.sh)

Once the Docker file is done, you will need to build and run it with their respective commands. 

2.	Using the public API from question 1, how would you obtain data and order it in any type of sort?

Once the data is decoded from the API response (Guzzle example), we will need to sort it using any of the sort PHP functions.
For example:

$data = json_decode($response)->getBody(), true);
usort($data, function($a, $b){
	return strcmp($a['name'], $b['name']);
});

3.	Access and inspect the Docker container to debug the issue.

First, I would read the container logs to look for a specific error 
	docker logs <container_name>
Test the script manually with debug mode
	bash -x /app/task.sh
Check whether volumes or mounts overwrote the script
	docker inspect <container_name>
You can inspect further by entering the container shell by running the following command:
	docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash


4.	Verify that the script exists and has the correct permissions.

To check that the script exists and their permissions you would need to run a simple ls command 
	ls -la /directory/ 
	
If permissions need to be modified, use the chmod command.


5.	Identify whether the issue originates in the Docker configuration, the script itself, or the process definition.

Using the docker inspect command you can check the information of the issue to determine what are the causes; either syntax errors, libraries not installed, wrong relative paths or environment variables.
You can also manually check the issue using the bash -x command. 

6.	Please mention which libraries you would use to generate a PDF, change font types.

I would use either dompdf or TCPDF to generate PDF files and to change the font types.

7.	How would you install a new package with composer?

composer require vendor/package-name
composer dump-autoload
