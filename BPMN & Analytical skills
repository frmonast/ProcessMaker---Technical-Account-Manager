1.	Please model a simple workflow in any BPMN tool

Event Start -> Submit Request -> Approval -> If Approved -> Generate script -> End
											-> If Rejected -> Notify Rejection -> End

2.	The steps you would follow to investigate where the process is stuck (e.g., tokens, script tasks, user tasks, boundary events).

- Locate and analyze the specific case/task.
- Inspect and check if the task has been completed and why it got stuck in approval.
- Make sure that the next task exists and is assigned correctly (Check workflow).
- Check for any conditions or events that may have triggered the reported issue. 
- If needed, duplicate the task and try to replicate the issue to maybe find the origin of the issue.


3.	How would you communicate with the client to gather information without overwhelming them technically?

First I would acknowledge the reported issue and apologize for any inconvenience.
I would ask the client to provide all the necessary information to analyze the reported issue. 
- Client Number or Task Number
- Any specific error messages (Screenshot if possible)
- Date of the issue
- Resolution Priority or Urgency

4.	How would you report progress and set realistic expectations?

After gathering all the necessary information about the reported issue, I would communicate to the client that we have started reviewing the issue and would give them an estimate of the next update or resolution.
Always provide clear timelines and keep the client informed (according to resolution progress).
Inform the client when the issue is resolved, giving a resolution summary avoiding technical terms but keeping it clear and simple.
