1.	Describe the systematic steps you would take to diagnose and resolve this issue.

First, one must try to replicate the error in the development or staging environment while running a debbuging tool or having logs enabled.
Check all error messages to analyze and diagnose the origin of the issue. 
Make sure all config files are correct and validate that the .env file was not overwritten.
Also, refresh or clear the cache since that is a common issue with old config values in Laravel.
Check and review recent changes or updates made.


2.	Mention specific Laravel tools or commands you would use (e.g., configuration caching, composer autoload, .env validation, logging).

For Debugging, I would temporarily enable debug in .env to check if there are any clear error messages.

Commands that I would use to clear any cache related issues:
	php artisan config:clear (Clear config cache)
	php artisan config:cache (Rebuild config cache)
	php artisan cache:clear (Clear general cache)
	php artisan route:clear (Clear route cache)
	php artisan view:clear (Clear view cache)


Logging & Debugging
php artisan tinker
php artisan tail



3.	Explain how the Laravel framework works under a design pattern like MVC.

When a user sends a request, a defined Route decides which Controller handles it.
The Controller interacts with the Models that access the information on the database.
Finally, the Controller returns the data to View which renders the HTML.

Model -> Handles database queries, relationships, mutators, accessors.
View -> Generate the HTML (Blade, Vue, etc.)
Controller -> Receives HTTP requests, uses models to get data and returns views or JSON responses.
